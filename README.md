## Description

GitPub is a front end web application that uses both the OpenBrewery API and the Yelp Fusion API to help you find local breweries fast and easy. Upon opening the live site, you will be presented with the opportunity to search for a city and then you will be taken to a page that displays all of the breweries in that city to you. From there, you can peruse the options, visits websites, check ratings, and find any other information you'd like about the breweries in your area. Should you find one that suits you, you can save it and your choice will be saved in local storage and there will be an element to redirect you back to that brewery's information.
